NAME
    savelogs - Save log files

SYNOPSIS
    savelogs saves your log files in a nice way (by default).

        savelogs --postmovehook='/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl graceful' \
                 --apacheconf=/www/conf/httpd.conf

        savelogs `cat list_of_logs_to_process.txt`

        savelogs --loglevel=2 /var/log/maillog /var/log/cronlog \
                 /var/log/messages

        savelogs --config=/etc/savelogs.conf

        savelogs --period=15 /var/log/messages

DESCRIPTION
    savelogs is a flexible and robust log file archival system. Its
    logic is simple: move (rename) the log file, filter data from
    the log file, store the log file in an archive (via tar or
    gtar), and compress the archive (via gzip or compress). After
    successful compression, the original log file is deleted.

    All of the above phases are optional. This means that you may
    simply delete files if you wish. Or you may simply compress
    existing log files. Or you may move files and add them to a tar
    file but leave the tar file uncompressed, etc. You pick ;o)

    savelogs has many options yet retains a high degree of dwimitude.

    savelogs should run on any architecture that runs Perl 5.
