## Settings in this file generally have been set to their
## corresponding savelogs internal defaults
##
## In order for savelogs to use this configuratino file, you must
## specify it with the --config option on the command-line:
##
##    % savelogs --config=/etc/savelogs.conf
##
## All of these configuration options may be overridden on the
## command-line when you execute savelogs. Please see savelogs(1) for
## more information on setting configuration directives.
##
## Savelogs treats all log paths as relative to your home directory.
## For example, if your home directory is really '/usr/home/joe' and
## you specified 'savelogs /var/log/messages', savelogs will look in
## ~/var/log/messages for the file instead. This is a feature.
## 
## Absolute paths are used in the PostMoveHook and Filter commands.
##
## Please read the man page savelogs(1).

## where to look when something goes wrong. This path is relative to
## your home directory.
LogFile                 /var/log/savelogs.log

## how verbose to be in the LogFile (set this between 0 and 5
## inclusive, 5 being most verbose).
LogLevel                1

## how big before we process a log? If you want to archive logs daily
## regardless of their size, comment out this directive
#Size                    500

## create a new zero-length log file after moving each log?
Touch                    no

## change ownership of the logs after moving them to this user
#Chown                   someuser

## change permissions of the logs after moving them to these
#Chmod                   0600

## rotate logs based on a period (i.e., how often you run savelogs)
## If you use the 'Period' option, you should also use 'Count' and
## the 'move' and 'compress' options for the 'Process' directive.
## You may also specify a number such as '10' to enable this. If you
## specify a value here, it will override the 'Count' variable.
#Period                  10
Period                  no

## how many logs to save when doing periodic log rotations. If no
## value is specified, a default of 10 is used. If a numeric value is
## specified for 'Period', that will be used regardless of the value
## associated with 'Count'.
#Count                   10

## add an extra character to the extension when moving files. If you
## rotate your logs more than once a day, set this to 'yes' (or
## 'true', or 'on', or 'yup').
Hourly                  no

## command to execute after moving log files. Another popular command is:
##
## kill -1 `ps -x | egrep 'Master:.+? \(https?d\)' | grep -v 'grep' | awk '{print $1}'`
##
## but we're not sure what this does ;o)
PostMoveHook            /usr/local/bin/restart_apache

## skip log files found in httpd.conf that match these patterns. Add
## additional ApacheLogExclude directives if you wish, one per line.
## The second exclude line will cause savelogs to skip log files that
## start with 'vhosts/joe'. The third line will cause savelogs to skip
## log files with the string 'error' anywhere in the log file name
ApacheLogExclude        ^/dev/null$
#ApacheLogExclude        ^vhosts/joe
#ApacheLogExclude        error

## where to find our log files. This path is relative to your home
## directory. Uncomment this if you want savelogs to find your logs
## for you
#ApacheConf              /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

## whether we follow Apache 'Include' directives in the Apache
## configuration file.
#ApacheInclude            no

## names of hosts whose logs we want to rotate. If specified, no other
## logs found in the Apache configuration file will be processed.
#ApacheHost               foo.com
#ApacheHost               bar.com

## what to look for in httpd.conf as a log file. This directive
## doesn't apply unless ApacheConf is specified
ApacheLog               TransferLog|ErrorLog|AgentLog|RefererLog|CustomLog

## clobber already compressed files (if this is not specified and
## savelogs is not run interactively, savelogs may not complete log
## processing)
Clobber                 1

## filter out lines with the string '/images/' in them. '$LOG' is a
## special variable that savelogs knows about which refers to the log
## file currently being processed.
#Filter                  egrep -v '/images/' $LOG

## store logs with full path information? If this is set to 'yes',
## logs will be archived with their full path information.
Full-Path               no

## which savelogs phases to process. See savelogs(1) for details.
## if you use the 'Period' option, 'move,compress' is assumed
## regardless of what you specifiy here (unless 'filter' is detected,
## in which case it will be 'move,filter,compress').
#Process                 all

## specify any logs you wish to process here or on the command line:
#Log                     /var/log/messages
#Log                     /var/log/proftpd
#Log                     /var/log/ace
