1.19

It is no longer necessary to use the --process=move,compress under
the --period option. If the --period option (or its configuration file
equivalent) is specified, the process options 'move,compress' are
automatically assumed. If you have specified a process option of
'filter', that will be honored also.

1.21

'move,compress' is now the default process option (not
move,filter,archive,compress,delete)

The period option takes an optional numeric argument as the count
argument. The count argument still works for backward compatibility
and some possible future directive dealing with tar files.

1.24

The default log level is now 0 (or totally silent) except in the
presence of errors.

1.25

Implicit process option 'filter' when filter option is given (i.e.,
you don't need to say '--process=filter').

1.26

Postmovehook output is captured internally and fed to LogFile (default=STDOUT).

1.27

Implicit process option 'archive' when archive option is given.


1.28

New directive 'StemHook' added.
